To create the infrastructure with Terraform and build/deploy a container through a pipeline for the link you provided, here is a breakdown of the process:

#Terraform to Create Infrastructure (Azure-based)
Set up the infrastructure on Azure using Terraform, which will involve creating a container registry, a virtual network, and a container instance.
Azure DevOps Pipeline to Build and Deploy the Container
Automate the container build (Docker) and deployment using Azure Pipelines.

Hereâ€™s the approach:

@Step 1: Infrastructure Code using Terraform
This Terraform configuration will provision the following:

Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store the Docker images.
Azure Container Instance (ACI) to run the Docker container.

@Step 2: Azure DevOps Pipeline (YAML)
This Azure Pipeline YAML will:

Build the Docker image.
Push the image to the Azure Container Registry (ACR).
Deploy the container using Azure CLI.
